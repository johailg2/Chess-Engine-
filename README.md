Chess Engine with Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Overview: 

This project is a Chess Engine paired with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to play chess against the engine. The engine is designed to evaluate chess positions and make optimal moves based on sophisticated algorithms.

Features: 

Chess Engine
Chess Rules Implementation: The engine correctly implements all chess rules, including special moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
Position Evaluation: The engine evaluates positions using a combination of material, mobility, king safety, and other factors to determine the best possible move.
Move Generation: Efficient move generation algorithms are implemented to ensure the engine can explore a large number of possible moves quickly.


Graphical User Interface (GUI)
User-Friendly Interface: The GUI is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to play chess games against the engine.
Move Input: Users can input moves via mouse clicks, and the GUI will update the board accordingly.

Real-Time Feedback: The GUI provides real-time feedback on the position and the engine's thought process.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Pygame (for the GUI)
Other dependencies (if any)

Future Enhancements: 
Difficulty Levels: Implement different levels of difficulty by adjusting the engine's depth of search and evaluation criteria.
Save and Load Games: Allow users to save and load games to continue later.
Improved Evaluation: Incorporate more advanced evaluation techniques, such as neural networks or machine learning.
Faster Evaluation: Use parallelization for searching on larger depths
